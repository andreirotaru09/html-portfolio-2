<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm 33 years old, married and father to a great little boy. Also I have a twin brother.</p>

<p>I have been working in sales one way or another for the last 13 years and I am looking to change my career path to a more technical role.</p>

<p>This small portfolio shows my first web development projects. I hope you enjoy it and if you have any questions or just want to get in touch, please check out the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>

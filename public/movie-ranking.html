<h1>Andrei's Top Movies</h1>
<h2>Thesre are my top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>No. 1 - The Godfather</h3>
<p>An intricate look inside the inner workings of the sicilian mafia in post-ware New York.
Francis Ford Copolla's masterpiece is everyone's go-to movie when it comes to mobster flicks and there are many reasons why.
It insists upon itself.
</p>
<h3>No. 2 - Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>My favourite Star Wars film, it really combines all the elements that make Star Wars
One of the greatest movie franchises of all time. Land and space battles, friendships that evolve or break down
and perhaps the most famous plot twist in cinema history. What's not to love?</p>
<h3>No. 3 - Back to the Future</h3>
<p>The entire "Back to the Future" series is fun to watch, but the first movie     
really is the greatest. Timeless characters, great action sequences and Hollywood's most famous 
time-travelling dog, Einie, make this one of the greatest blockbuster movies ever made.
